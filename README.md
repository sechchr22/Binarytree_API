# BINARYTREE REST_API

Basic RestAPI to handle a Binarytree as a resource.

Core Functionality:
  - To create a binarytree
  - To find the last common ancester of 2 nodes

## Basic Concepts

#### Binarytree

A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.

A Binary Tree node contains following parts.

- Data
- left child
- right child

#### Binarytree module in Python

In Python, a binary tree can be represented in different ways with different data structures(dictionary, list) and class representation for a node. However, binarytree library helps to directly implement a binary tree. It also supports heap and binary search tree(BST). This module does not come pre-installed with Pythons standard utility module. To install it type the below command in the terminal.

```sh
pip install binarytree
```
#### Build a binary tree from a List
We can use build() method to convert a list of values into a binary tree.

Here, a given list contains the nodes of tree such that the element at index i has its left child at index 2*i+1, the right child at index 2*i+2 and parent at (i - 1)//2. The elements at index j for j>len(list)//2 are leaf nodes. None indicates the absence of a node at that index. We can also get the list of nodes back after building a binary tree using values attribute.

Example:
```sh
# Creating binary tree from given list 
from binarytree import build 

nodes =[3, 6, 8, 2, 11, None, 13] 
binary_tree = build(nodes) 

print('Binary tree from list :\n', 
      binary_tree) 
```
Output:
```
Binary tree from list :
    ___3
   /    \
  6      8
 / \      \
2   11     13
```

## Environment

You need the following enviroment to run this API.

#### Create the user and database in PostgreSQL
Login and Connect as Default User
```sh
$ sudo -u postgres psql
```
At the psql command prompt
```sh
CREATE USER sech;
```
Setup password
```sh
ALTER USER sech password 'gokuaddicte';
```
Create database
```sh
CREATE DATABASE binarytrees;
```

## Installation

After having the environment setted up, clone the repository.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sechchr22/Binarytree_API
```

## RUN

To run the API use the following command from the Binarytree_API folder.
```sh
python3 -m api.v1.app
```
Output:
```sh
* Serving Flask app "app" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
